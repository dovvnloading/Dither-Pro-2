## About
**Dither Pro 2.0** is a standalone Windows application designed to bring advanced image dithering algorithms to a modern, accessible desktop interface. Unlike web-based or cloud-dependent tools, Dither Pro runs entirely on your local machine, ensuring maximum performance and complete privacy for your files.

Whether you are looking to emulate 1-bit Macintosh graphics, prepare images for E-Ink displays, or create retro "pixel art" aesthetics, Dither Pro provides the granular control needed for professional results without requiring an internet connection.

## Key Features

### Advanced Dithering Engines
Access a library of industry-standard error diffusion and ordered dithering algorithms:
* **Error Diffusion:** Floyd-Steinberg, Atkinson, Jarvis-Judice-Ninke, Stucki, Burkes, Sierra (Lite, 2-Row, 3-Row).
* **Ordered patterns:** Bayer matrices (2x2, 4x4, 8x8) and Cluster Dot halftones.
* **Serpentine Scanning:** Reduce linear artifacts by processing pixels in alternating directions.

### Color Science
* **Custom Palettes:** Built-in presets for Gameboy, CGA, Neon, Vaporwave, and Monochrome.
* **Dynamic Quantization:** Generate optimized palettes from your source image using Median Cut or Popularity algorithms.
* **Perceptual Matching:** Toggle between Euclidean distance and "Redmean" color metrics for human-eye accuracy.

### Professional Workflow
* **Non-Destructive Editing:** Full Undo/Redo history stack.
* **Live Split-View:** Compare your original image and the dithered output side-by-side in real-time.
* **Image Enhancement:** Built-in pre-processing for brightness, contrast, saturation, blur, and sharpening.
* **Pixel Scaling:** Downsample images (1x to 8x) for authentic retro resolution emulation.

### Performance
* **Local Processing:** No API calls. No uploads. 100% Offline.
* **Native Architecture:** Optimized for Windows to handle heavy computation and high-resolution images with zero latency.
